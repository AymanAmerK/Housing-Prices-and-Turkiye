# International Housing and Rental Trends: An In-Depth Exploration with Emphasis on Türkiye


Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of housing and rental prices across various countries, with a special focus on Türkiye. Using multivariate data from the OECD Statistical Database, we explore trends from 1994 to 2023. The analysis covers key metrics such as real house price indices, price-to-income ratios, rent prices, and price-to-rent ratios.



Objectives

1- Exploratory Data Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in Türkiye's housing and renting prices.

2- Comparison with the United States: Contrast Türkiye’s housing market trends with those of the U.S. to uncover similarities and differences.

3- Temporal Analysis: Track changes in housing and renting prices over time in Türkiye to spot significant trends or fluctuations.



Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of annual indices adjusted for seasonality, with 2015 as the base year. It is a valuable resource for understanding housing market dynamics and socioeconomic trends in Türkiye and beyond.



Data Manipulation Tasks

- Loading the Data: Data was loaded and preprocessed using the Pandas library.
- Cleaning the Data: Unnecessary columns were removed, and missing values were handled.
- Enhancing Analysis: New columns like “PCT_CHANGE” were added to calculate year-over-year percentage changes in housing prices.
- Grouping and Aggregation: Data was grouped by country for further analysis, with a focus on Türkiye.



Key Findings

- Türkiye experienced the highest cumulative housing price growth (around 240%) among analyzed countries from 2013 to 2023.
- Most countries' rent indices cluster in the 80-150 range relative to 2015, but some markets (like Türkiye) saw extreme rent inflation.
- Price-to-income ratios in 2023 varied significantly across countries, with Portugal showing a 50% increase and Romania a 40% decrease compared to 2015 levels.
- In Türkiye, all housing measures (price-to-rent ratio, real house price index, and rent prices) showed an upward trend, with significant spikes after 2021.
- Türkiye's housing market experienced more volatility and rapid growth compared to the Euro area, especially after 2020.
- Rent prices in Türkiye increased dramatically, reaching nearly four times the 2015 levels by 2023.
- Real House Price Indices in Türkiye increased in approximately 69% of the years analyzed.



Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations to illustrate key findings:

- Top 10 Countries by Housing Price Change: Bar plot highlighting countries with the highest cumulative price growth.
- Rent Price Distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of rent prices across countries.
- Price-to-Income Ratio in 2023: Analysis of housing affordability across different nations.
- Türkiye vs. Euro Area: Comparison of real house price indices and rent prices between Türkiye and the Euro Area.
- Year-over-Year Real House Price Indices in Türkiye: Pie chart showing the ratio of years with increasing versus decreasing house prices.



Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the housing market, particularly in Türkiye. By understanding these trends, policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders can make informed decisions to address housing challenges and promote sustainable development.
