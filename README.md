# International Housing and Rental Trends: An In-Depth Exploration with Emphasis on Türkiye


Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of housing and rental prices across various countries, with a special focus on Türkiye. Using multivariate data from the OECD Statistical Database, we explore trends from 1994 to 2023. The analysis covers key metrics such as real house price indices, price-to-income ratios, rent prices, and price-to-rent ratios.



Objectives

1- Exploratory Data Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in Türkiye's housing and renting prices.

2- Comparison with the United States: Contrast Türkiye’s housing market trends with those of the U.S. to uncover similarities and differences.

3- Temporal Analysis: Track changes in housing and renting prices over time in Türkiye to spot significant trends or fluctuations.



Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of annual indices adjusted for seasonality, with 2015 as the base year. It is a valuable resource for understanding housing market dynamics and socioeconomic trends in Türkiye and beyond.



Data Manipulation Tasks

- Loading the Data: Data was loaded and preprocessed using the Pandas library.
- Cleaning the Data: Unnecessary columns were removed, and missing values were handled.
- Enhancing Analysis: New columns like “PCT_CHANGE” were added to calculate year-over-year percentage changes in housing prices.
- Grouping and Aggregation: Data was grouped by country for further analysis, with a focus on Türkiye.
